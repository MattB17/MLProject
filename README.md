### Introduction

This code is in fulfillment of the final course project for CSC2515 at the University of Toronto.

We trained a set of models on the [goodreads dataset](https://sites.google.com/eng.ucsd.edu/ucsdbookgraph/home) to predict whether or not a user would recommend a given book. A recommendation is defined as a rating greater than 3. In particular, the predictive task was as follows: given a user `u` and a book `i`, will user `u` recommend book `i`. Due to resource limitations, we restricted our focus to the poetry category.
